1)Write all the problems and their solutions (the root cause and the change required to solve the issue) in the SOLUTION.md file.
2)Example: Error 1: The "XXX" service pod is going in "ImagePullBackOff" state. Solution: The "XXX" YAML manifest had a typo in image value, after updating the image repository the error disappeared.
Guidelines:
a)This assignment is divided in 3 parts, Part-A, Part-B, and Part-C.
b)For every part, you will have to perform certain task(s). Make sure whenever you make any changes in the YAML manifests to solve any problem, you should commit the changes
c)The SOLUTION.md file also needs to be updated with a small description of the exact problem/error and it's solution. You can also mention the commands that are required to perform any operation while solving any issue.
d)This assignment will require the changes to be made only in the Kubernetes manifests files. There is no need to make any changes in the application code, Docker images.
